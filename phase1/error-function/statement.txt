Error Function

You are given n floating point numbers (x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n)
For each x_i, calculate erf(x_i) where erf is the [error function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function)
using the `erf` function from c's standard library


Input:
The first line contains n
The next n lines contain n ieee-754 double precision floating points encoded
in hex (16 hex digits to be exact, see sample input and output)


Output:
For each of the n numbers, output the result of the error function in the
same format as input.


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100000

Sample:

input 0:
```
2
3ff0000000000000
0000000000000000
```

output 0:
```
3feaf767a741088b
0000000000000000
```


Note: The first value in input corresponds to 1.0 and first value in output
is roughly equal to 0.842701
